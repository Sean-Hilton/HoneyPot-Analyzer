# SecurityFinalProject
Analyzing honeypot logs to determine type, origin, and vector of attacks.

To generate a report, set a relative or absolute path in 'path_to_folder' in main. If this is a folder, a combined report will be generated for all files it finds. If it only finds one file it will just generate a report for that file. No report will be generated if no valid file was found.
